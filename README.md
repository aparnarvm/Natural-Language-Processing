### 1.Comparative Sentiment Analysis using VADER in NLTK and Hugging Face's Pretrained Model.
Research Question : How does the Sentiment Analysis performance using VADER in NLTK compare with 
the Hugging Face's RoBERTa pretrained model when analyzing Women's E-commerce Clothing reviews?

This project investigates the efficacy of sentiment analysis in Women's E-commerce Clothing reviews 
through a comparative study between VADER in NLTK and Hugging Face's RoBERTa pretrained model. 
Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising reviews and corresponding rating scores provided 
by customers, the research aims to examine the performance disparities between these two sentiment 
analysis approaches by examining the scores (positive, negative, neutral and combined) given by both 
VADER and the pretrained model, and see how the responses differ from the ground truth rating scores. 
Along with it an Exploratory Data Analysis will also be done on the dataset using various NLTK features, 
will check which model was better at identifying sarcasm, ambiguity and other challenges and the comparison 
will also be visualized using plots.
